I am using Obsidian to create this blog and also using sveltekit to render it to my website blog.

I want to see how it all works out and how it is displayed.

# First Heading

## Second Heading

### Third Heading

#### Fourth Heading

##### Fifth Heading

###### Sixth Heading


+ List
+ Second Item

1. First Number
2. Second

> Quoted text I want to see

```
a = 1
b = 2
you = 'awesome'
me  = 'sweet'
we  = you + me
print(we)
```

This is how image would be displayed ðŸ‘‡
